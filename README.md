*I took the course of machine learning on Coursera, which was taught by professor Andrew Ng.*
*The original programming exercises were implemented in MATLAB/Octave, and I rewrote them in Python using iPython notebook.*
*Hope what I share could help someone fascinated by data science and machine learning, just like me:)*
